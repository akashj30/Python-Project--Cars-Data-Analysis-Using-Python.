# Python Project-2
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing : We begin by loading the car dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, addressing missing values, and removing duplicates to ensure data quality.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Using descriptive statistics and visualizations, we uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data, providing a foundational understanding of car attributes and trends.

- Visualization Techniques : Employing Matplotlib and Seaborn, we create insightful visualizations that highlight key findings, such as popular car models, attribute distributions, and correlations between variables.

- Challenges and Solutions : We tackle challenges such as outliers, complex relationships, and visualization selection by leveraging Python's data analysis capabilities and applying our analytical skills.

- Future Enhancements : Opportunities for future work include advanced techniques like predictive modeling with machine learning and integrating additional datasets to enrich our analysis and insights further.
